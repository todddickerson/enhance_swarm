This release resolves critical orchestration issues that prevented multi-agent coordination from working reliably, plus adds comprehensive Bullet Train support and modern workflow features.

#### üí• Breaking Orchestration Issues Fixed
- **‚úÖ CRITICAL: Worktree Merge Strategy** - Agents now properly merge changes back to main project (was creating "phantom completions")
- **‚úÖ CRITICAL: Orchestration Timeout Controls** - Added 120-second timeouts with proper error handling (was hanging indefinitely)
- **‚úÖ CRITICAL: Bullet Train Super Scaffolding Compliance** - Enhanced prompts force proper BT conventions instead of manual Rails models
- **‚úÖ CRITICAL: Task Decomposition Integration** - Fixed agent spawning pipeline preventing orchestration from starting

#### üöÄ New Features
- **‚úÖ Detached Mode (`--detached`)** - Non-blocking orchestration with background execution and progress monitoring
- **‚úÖ Orchestration Status Monitoring** - Real-time status checking with `enhance-swarm status` command
- **‚úÖ Enhanced Error Handling** - Specific exception handling for timeout, interruption, and system errors
- **‚úÖ Comprehensive Logging** - Structured logs in `.enhance_swarm/logs/` with orchestration progress tracking

#### üé® Bullet Train Enhancements
- **‚úÖ Tailwind CSS Default** - BT projects now correctly use Tailwind CSS instead of Bootstrap by default
- **‚úÖ Enhanced BT Prompting** - Mandatory Super Scaffolding execution sequences with explicit command requirements
- **‚úÖ BT Pattern Compliance** - Proper magic comments (üöÖ), includes, and team-scoped architecture enforcement
- **‚úÖ BT Theme Integration** - Full `bullet_train-themes-tailwind_css` support with design token usage

#### üîß Technical Improvements

#### üìã Real-World Validation
Production testing shows consistent **2-3 minute orchestration** with **10-15 files created**, including:
- Complete CRUD systems with models, controllers, views, migrations
- Professional-grade validations and test suites (RSpec with Factory Bot)
- Responsive UI with proper framework styling (Tailwind for BT, Bootstrap/Tailwind for Rails)
- Automatic git commits with all changes properly merged

#### üìö Documentation Updates
- **Updated README** with detached mode examples and monitoring instructions
- **Real-world examples** with actual file counts and completion times
- **Quick reference** guide with essential commands and options
- **Bullet Train setup** instructions with Tailwind CSS defaults

### üéØ Migration Guide from v2.0.0

**Recommended Usage Change:**
