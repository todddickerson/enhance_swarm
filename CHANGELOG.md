## [0.1.1] - 2024-06-28

### Security
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed command injection vulnerabilities in shell execution
- **CRITICAL**: Replaced unsafe backticks and `system()` calls with secure `Open3.capture3`
- **CRITICAL**: Added comprehensive input sanitization for all configuration values
- Added `CommandExecutor` class with argument escaping and command validation
- Implemented timeout protection against hanging processes
- Added validation patterns to prevent dangerous shell commands

### Quality
- Fixed 602 RuboCop violations (90% reduction from 670 to 68)
- Added comprehensive error handling across all modules
- Implemented proper exception hierarchies with custom error classes
- Added timeout handling and graceful degradation
- Improved code consistency and formatting

### Testing
- Added 30 comprehensive tests covering security-critical components
- Added `CommandExecutor` test suite with security validation
- Added `Configuration` validation tests
- Added `Orchestrator` sanitization tests
- Added RSpec test framework setup

### Changed
- All shell command execution now uses secure `CommandExecutor` class

- Error messages are more descriptive and actionable
- Command arguments are properly escaped to prevent injection
- Shell metacharacters are stripped from configuration values

### Fixed
- Command injection vulnerabilities in `orchestrator.rb`, `task_manager.rb`, `mcp_integration.rb`, `generator.rb`
- Unsafe shell interpolation in Git hook generation
- Missing error handling for external command failures
- RuboCop violations for string literals, method complexity, and formatting
- Assignment in condition warnings
