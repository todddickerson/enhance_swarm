# EnhanceSwarm 🚀

**Production-ready intelligent multi-agent orchestration for Claude with real dev team coordination.**

EnhanceSwarm transforms Claude into a sophisticated development team that works like real developers - with specialized agents for Backend, Frontend, QA, and Integration that collaborate intelligently with minimal overlap.

## ✨ What Makes EnhanceSwarm Different

- **🧠 Intelligent Orchestration**: Control agent delegates tasks to specialized agents like a real project manager
- **🤖 Real Claude CLI Integration**: Spawns authentic Claude agents using your local Claude CLI  
- **👥 Dev Team Simulation**: Backend → Frontend → QA → Integration workflow with smart handoffs
- **🎯 Zero Overlap**: Agents work on specialized tasks with dependency-aware coordination
- **📊 Smart Defaults**: Auto-detects project type and creates optimal team coordination
- **🛡️ Production Ready**: Enterprise security, resource management, and comprehensive testing

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
gem install enhance_swarm
```

### Initialize in Your Project
```bash
cd your_project
enhance-swarm init
```

### Run Intelligent Multi-Agent Development
```bash
# Orchestrate a complete feature with specialized agents
enhance-swarm orchestrate "Add user authentication with email verification"

# Or use the enhanced ENHANCE protocol
enhance-swarm enhance
# Then enter: "Build a todo management system with real-time updates"
```

## 🎯 How It Works

### Intelligent Task Delegation
1. **Control Agent** analyzes your request and project context
2. **Task Decomposition** breaks complex features into specialized subtasks  
3. **Smart Coordination** assigns tasks to specialist agents with dependencies
4. **Quality Assurance** QA agent reviews each implementation
5. **Integration** Lead agent merges everything seamlessly

### Agent Specialization
| Agent | Role | Responsibilities |
|-------|------|------------------|
| **Backend** | API & Logic Developer | Models, APIs, business logic, database design |
| **Frontend** | UI/UX Developer | Components, styling, user experience, interactions |
| **QA** | Quality Engineer | Testing, validation, security, edge cases |
| **Integration** | Tech Lead | Merging, refining, final polish, deployment prep |

### Smart Coordination Example
```bash
enhance-swarm orchestrate "Add contact management to the app"
```

**Behind the scenes:**
1. 🎯 Control agent creates specialized subtasks
2. 🔧 Backend agent: Creates Contact model, API endpoints, validations  
3. 🎨 Frontend agent: Builds contact forms, list views, search functionality
4. 🧪 QA agent: Creates comprehensive test suites for all features
5. 🔗 Integration agent: Merges everything, resolves conflicts, final polish

### Frontend Agent  
**Focus**: User interfaces, styling, user experience
- Creates intuitive and responsive interfaces
- Maintains consistent design patterns and components
- Implements modern CSS and JavaScript best practices
- Ensures accessibility and cross-browser compatibility
- Integrates seamlessly with backend APIs

### QA Agent
**Focus**: Testing, validation, quality assurance
- Creates comprehensive test suites (unit, integration, system)
- Validates functionality against requirements
- Checks for security vulnerabilities and edge cases
- Provides actionable feedback for improvements
- Ensures code quality and maintainability

### Integration Agent
**Focus**: Merging, coordination, final polish
- Intelligently merges work from all specialist agents

  coordination_enabled: true
  smart_handoffs: true

agents:
  backend:
    specialization: "APIs, models, business logic"
    best_practices: ["Rails conventions", "Service objects", "Strong validations"]
  frontend:
    specialization: "UI/UX, components, styling"  
    best_practices: ["Responsive design", "Component reuse", "Accessibility"]
```

### Resource Management
```yaml
resources:
  max_memory_mb: 2048
  max_disk_mb: 1024
  max_concurrent_agents: 10
```

## 🛡️ Production Features

### Security
- Command injection protection with comprehensive input sanitization
- Role-based agent validation and secure execution environments
